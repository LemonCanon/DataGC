Codebook
The script "run_analysis" takes the data from the files:

	UCI HAR Dataset/test
	UCI HAR Dataset/train

Details on the files are within "UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt"
	
The script produces the cleaned_UCI_HAR_Dataset.txt and UCI_HAR_Dataset_bySubject.txt that use the
following headers (UCI_HAR_Dataset_bySubject.txt does not use "activity" or "dataset"):

"subjectID"                
	integers 1 to 30 indicating which volunteer was measured for the observation.

"activity"
	factor w/6 levels indicating which activity was observed
		"WALKING" "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" "SITTING" "STANDING" "LAYING"     

"dataset" 
	factor w/2 levels indicating which dataset the observation originated from
		"test" "train"

The following headers come from the UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt and UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt files and are all 
numeric values each representing means and standard deviations (Std) taken from signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial
raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. further details available in UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt

In UCI_HAR_Dataset_bySubject.txt each column represents the mean of all the measurements collected from a subject performing each 
activity.

For readability I have grouped similar headers together though they still appear in the same order as they do in the table
reading from left to right.
all values have been normalized to values between -1.0 and 1.0
t. denotes time domain signals
f. denotes frequency domain signals
