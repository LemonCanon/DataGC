The script "run_analysis" takes the data from the files:

	UCI HAR Dataset/test
	UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals
	UCI HAR Dataset/train
	UCI HAR Dataset/train/Inertial Signals

Details on the files are within "UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt"
	
The script produces the cleaned_UCI_HAR_Dataset.txt a dataset with the 
following headers:

"subjectID"    
	Numbers 1 - 30 indicating which of the 30 volunteers the measurements were collected from.  
"activity" 
    A factor indicating which action the subject was performing for the measurements.
"dataSet" 
	A factor indicating which dataset the entry originated from, either train or test.
"X.avg" 
	The average of a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
"X.stan"
	The standard deviation of a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables

The following 6 headers are the averages and standard deviations of the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total
acceleration, the measurements are in the axis x, y and z. 

	"accX.avg" "accX.stan"  
	"accY.avg" "accY.stan"
	"accZ.avg" "accZ.stan"
	
The following 6 headers are the averages and standard deviations of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample in 
each observation. The units are radians/second.
    
	"gyroX.avg" "gyroX.stan"
	"gyroY.avg" "gyroY.stan"   
	"gyroZ.avg" "gyroZ.stan" 

The following 6 headers are the means and standard deviations for the acceleration signal from the 
smartphone accelerometer x, y, and z axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Each original entry contained 
an 128 element vector.  
	
	"totaccX.avg" "totaccX.stan"
	"totaccY.avg" "totaccY.stan" 
	"totaccZ.avg" "totaccZ.stan"
